# SpellingCorrectionEditor
This a consol text editor developed C++, with a spelling correction and pedicitve text writing
This project uses a "French" dictionnary, and maybe it will have multiple languages someday.

In this Text editor, you will have two different modes: the spelling corrector mode and the predictive text writing mode.

1) When you chose the first mode, you will chose wether you write a text yourself or chose a .txt file from your computer.
After writing or choosing the text the algorithme will start to find any incorrect word and the it will give you the choice
to chose the correct word or to add the wrong word to the disctionnary. 

2) When you chose the second mode, you will be able to write a sentence and when you want to show predictions just finish
your sentence with a "*" and then you will find some propositions from the database and you will add a word also to the 
base.

Thanks for reading hope you find what you are searching for :)
